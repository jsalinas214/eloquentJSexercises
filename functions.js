/*
  Recursion
  
  -- Zero is even.
  -- One is odd.
  -- Foi any other number N, its eveness is the same as N - 2.
  
  Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description.
  the function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and returns a boolean.
  Test it on 50 and 75. See how it behaves on -1. Why? Can you think of a way to fix this?

/*
  Bean Counting
  
  Write a fucntion countBs that takes a string as its only argument and 
  returns a number that indicates how many uppercase "B" characters there are in the string.
  
  Next, write a funciton called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicstes the character that is to be counted.
  
  Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.
